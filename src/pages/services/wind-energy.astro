    heading='Wind Energy Systems'
    text='Wind energy systems harness the power of wind to generate electricity. They are a form of renewable energy that contributes to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and dependence on fossil fuels. Wind energy systems consist of various components that work together to capture and convert wind energy into usable electricity. There are two primary categories/types of wind energy systems: onshore and offshore.'

            Onshore wind energy systems are installed on land and are the most
            common type of wind energy installations. They consist of the
            following main components:

            Offshore wind energy systems are installed in bodies of water,
            usually in shallow coastal areas or continental shelves. They have
            similar components to onshore systems, but with some differences:

          Both onshore and offshore wind energy systems come in various sizes,
          ranging from small-scale installations suitable for residential use to
          large utility-scale wind farms. The technology behind wind energy
          systems continues to advance, resulting in more efficient and
          cost-effective solutions for generating clean electricity from the
          wind.
